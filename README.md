DESCRIPTION
This tool helps explore the trends and patterns in the feedback data AutoCAD 360 recieves. There are two charts - one Web and one Mobile data. Each stacked bar represents a single post from a user. The bars are categoriezed and colored by Question, Problem, Idea, and Praise. The most popular of those are listed below each graph.

The tool is updated upon loading. The charts automatically scale with new data. This tool will be accurate even without manual updates.
